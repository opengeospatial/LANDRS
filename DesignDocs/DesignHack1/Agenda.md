### Drone Data Design Hackathon Tuesday 16 july 2019

**10:15 - 11:45 (90min) Morning talks:**
   - Intro
   - Current drone data tooling:
      - Joe Adams: USGS drone data technical stack
      - Sudhir Shrestha: Esri drone data technical stack
      - Chris Schnaufer: Cyverse and drone data
      - John Graybeal: Introduction to CEDAR

**11:45 - 12:45 Lunch (60min)**

**12:45 - 18:00 Unconfernce**
   **12:45 - 13:00: Unconference pitches:**
   1. Hacking at a dummy OpenAPI demo: What the linked data documents we need look like and how OpenAPI can be molded for our needs
   2. Building out the vocab and standardised conceptual models we need: creating the required missing models
   3. CEDAR as a tool for schema harmonization: strategising how and what we need to do
   4. Community building & governance: Creating a API features specification through application compentancy questions
